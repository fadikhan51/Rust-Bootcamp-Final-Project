<h2>Project Details</h2>
<p>A user-friendly inventory management system for a small retail store using Rust. The system allows store managers to effortlessly add, edit, and delete products, each defined by a name, description, price, and quantity. Robust error handling ensures data integrity, while basic security measures, including authentication with the username and password 'admin,' prevent unauthorized access. The system's clear text-based interface facilitates seamless navigation, empowering store managers to generate concise reports of the store's inventory. This Rust-based solution leverages core language features, such as structs, enums, and error handling, to build a reliable and efficient tool for small-scale retail operations.</p>

<h2>Vision</h2>
<p>Our vision is to revolutionize small retail businesses with a streamlined inventory management system in Rust. By empowering store managers to effortlessly control product information and inventory levels, we aim to enhance efficiency, reduce errors, and ultimately optimize the overall retail experience. Through user-friendly interfaces and robust security measures, our project ensures a seamless and secure environment for managing inventory. The impact extends beyond efficiency, fostering growth and profitability for small retailers, unlocking the potential for scalability and success in an ever-evolving market. Our vision is to be a catalyst for positive change, bringing simplicity and empowerment to small-scale retail operations.</p>
